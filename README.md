# LT-WEB-NO1

## Database check (SQLite)
- Use `api/db_check.php` to verify PHP has `pdo_sqlite` enabled and the SQLite file is reachable.
- Run it once during setup or when you see DB connection errors (not required after every change).

## Run with npm/pnpm (development)

2. From the project root run:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

This runs the backend and frontend servers.

- The frontend server runs on port 5173 by default.
- The backend server runs on port 8000 by default.
